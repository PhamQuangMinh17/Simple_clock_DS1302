# Simple_clock_DS1302

Description: 
Simple clock with Arduino UNO and Real Time Clock DS1302. This small project aim to explore I2C communication protocol between MCU and prripheral device. 

Functionality: 
- Pause and start clock by button switch. 
- Adjusting time: Hours, Minutes, Seconds with input button switch.
- Project don't use internal built-in clock of arduino UNO.

Components.
- Arduino UNO: MCU
- DS1302 : Clock keeper
- 4-digit 7 segment LED: Display time.
- 4 buttons: Controlling clock: 1 button to start clock. 1 button to swtich digit. 2 buttons for increment and decrement value.  
- 2 LED: 1 LED indicate clock in time adjusting state and 1 LED indicate clock in operating state (clock counting).
